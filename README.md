# Boot Camp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- My motivation for creating this project was to give some basic information on a few different languages on how a website is created, modified and maintained
- I learned quite a bit about the basics with my prework modules and from the websites listed below. I'm very excited to gain more knowledge in coding to make it a long and enjoyable career! 

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section or refer to the websites listed below. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics I learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
